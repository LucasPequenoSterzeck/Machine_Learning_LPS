# Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs

This repository contains my solutions and project work for the "Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs" online course. The course offers a practical and coding-focused introduction to deep learning using the PyTorch framework. It covers various topics, including PyTorch basics, gradient descent, working with images, logistic regression, training deep neural networks on GPUs, image classification with convolutional neural networks, data augmentation, regularization, generative adversarial networks, transfer learning, and more.
